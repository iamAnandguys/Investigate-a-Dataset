* least earning Drema movie.
* I will analyze the years wise average_vote_count. Profit trends of Drema movies.
* Average Runtime of Drema Movies.
* Which properties are affect popularity of movies. Budget and Popularity trends.

In This Project I have worked on Jupyter Notebook and used python library

* Pandas
* Numpy as np
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn as sns
* matplotlib inline
